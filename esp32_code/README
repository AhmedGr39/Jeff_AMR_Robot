# ESP32 Firmware for Jeff AMR

This folder contains the code that runs on the ESP32 microcontroller.

## Hardware Components

- ESP32-WROOM-32
- DRV8833 Motor Driver
- 2x DC Gear Motors with Encoders (104 ticks/rev)
- Mini 360 5V Regulator (for ESP32)
- XL4015 10V Regulator (for motors)
- Rotary encoders connected to GPIOs with interrupts
- LED PWM pins via `ledcWrite`

## Firmware Files

- `esp32_microRos.ino`: Handles motor control, encoder readings, and publishes odometry to ROS2 via micro-ROS.
- `esp32_web_interface.ino`: Basic web server to control the robot manually.

## Notes

- PWM frequency is set to `500 Hz` to reduce motor noise.
- Uses a basic PID controller for smoother motion.
